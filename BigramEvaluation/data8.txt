+ eax settings somewhat superfluous not really negative
- locations various buttons side somewhat illogical
- either not play song skip wildly no matter unit resting desk
- had been strange noises obvious defects accepted replacement clearly defective inferior operating system not intend waiting patches
- product too fragile normal
- creative software not real intuitive
- software somewhat nice using not easiest
- rename cd title already transferred become frustrated quite quickly
- scroll wheel blunt sucks
- seems always difficult press make selection
- little cumbersome scroll through many levels selection
- cutouts controls not thought too much material adequately access controls especially scroll wheel
- main reason not satisfied product fact lock odd times
- quite simply firmware os control thing not ready prime time
- size little bit bigger ipod weighs little bit more
- scroll button not best sometimes hard select
- gave stars due fact thest broke dropped fairly short distance
- appears player does not play itunes
- navigation artist album ok however miss ability navigate folders
- not navigate genre artist album since under genre tracks genre no division
- software comes player not good
- software bundled creative products useless ugly
- scroll bar travesty
- software another great misfortune hard operate crashes frequently screwed music library doesnt mp4s list goes
- software failed repeatedly
- software downloads site crashed pc
- has few inconveniences songs not automatically play another like cd
- case strong stylish unfortunately lacks window
- nomad jukebox zen xtra very good mp3 player software gets hurt
