data.txt present in this folder is slightly different from the original data.txt uploaded earlier. Reason for the difference is as follows:

Intially, we intended our reviews to follow a particular format in which there is space between every word including punctuation marks and full stops. 

For example :
+ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
+ i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
+ definetely a great camera . proven canon built quality and lens . feels solid in hand .rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
+ a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
+ bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 

But few of the reviews in the original data.txt doesn't follow this pattern. Therefore, we modified the data.txt so that it follows the convention mentioned above.
